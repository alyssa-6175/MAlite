    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Thai Iced Tea</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>hmm... i do enjoy thai iced tea too i suppose. quite a sweet drink. makes sense for such a sweet person !!!!
            (i'm talking about me, obviously) probably better with boba, though, if i'm
            being honest (which
            i am). shivali must've meant to
            put 'thai iced tea with boba' in the heading. well.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Hakka Noodles</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>i'll bet anyone reading this five dollars that you've never heard of hakka noodles (unless you're shivali.
            then obviously you have. no five dollars for you.) so then what <strong>are</strong> they??? they are
            stir-fried noodles.. sometimes spicy, always yummy
            <br>
            <br>
            it has recently occured to me that hakka noodles are actually chinese food... chinese cuisine...
            originating from china.. oops !!

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pineapple Pizza</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>one would think that all of shivali's favorite foods would be of the cuisine from india. but no, she's such
            an internationall appreciative and diverse girl! with such unique tastes! she's here
            to surprise you with some fresh fun sweet and tangy pineapple pizza! quite a controversial food i suppose,
            but oh well- i guess she's not a true italian....

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Chilli Paneer</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>chilli paneer is an indian dish made from adding chilli sauce to paneer. what is paneer? good question !! are
            we sure shivali's spice tolerance is high enough for this? maybe that's why thai iced tea is number one...

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pineapple fried rice</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>i LOVE pineapple fried rice !! one of my favorite things to put pineapple in. this is the second appearance
            of pineapple on this very short 'shivali's favorite food' list, so i think it's safe to assume shivali
            really like pineapples? perhaps one of her favorite fruits, even. personally, not for me. too tangy and it
            burns my tounge. very acidy. pineapple fried rice is good though because you cook away all the sourness and
            then it's just limp and sweet. good choice shivali.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        as the third most popular fried rice in the world, i would hope you neednt find out more about it..........
